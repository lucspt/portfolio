# Portfolio

[Live site](https://lucspt.github.io/portfolio/)

Hey! This is the code for my portfolio. Just like the website: make yourself at home!

I built it with:

- React
- CSS
- Vite

This portfolio, and therefore the projects it showcases, are more centered around
my web development projects. Though you can find other project types, like machine 
learning ones, on my [profile homepage](https://github.com/lucspt).

Let me know which project you like best!
